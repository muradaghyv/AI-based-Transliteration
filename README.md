"As it is known, after Azerbaijan obtained its independence, precisely in 1991, with the decision on the restoration of the Azerbaijani language in the Latin script, the Azerbaijani language officially switched to the Latin script. It should be noted that until 1991, writing scripts in the Azerbaijani language changed several times, but after the occupation of the USSR, since 1920, writing in the Azerbaijani language was done in the Cyrillic script. During these 70 years, the development of science in the world gave impetus to the development of science in the society of Azerbaijan, and during those 70 years, Azerbaijan brought several important professors and scientists to the world. There are dozens, maybe hundreds of works, as well as research papers, authored by those scientists. Also, taking into account the lack of use of smart phones and computers in those years, these important research papers are available in Cyrillic script in only books. I think that if I can increase the reading and accessibility of the very important and essential research works in those books, this important information can help to start new research projects and to develop Azerbaijan exceptionally in the field of science. The method I propose is a model application, which can extract the text from the images, and after extracting this text, it can be stored in the same alphabet and transferred to a more convenient version (PDF format, word document, etc.). Also, after extracting the text from the image, the model converts the text to Latin script. I would also like to note that the model also has the ability to make adjustments to images, send and save created documents to email addresses, and other functions, all of which will be explained in more detail in future parts of my diploma work."
